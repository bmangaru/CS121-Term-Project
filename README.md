Overview: 

The program is a medicine logging system designed to assist an individual in tracking their medication usage, specifically an asthma inhaler. The system prompts the user to log whether they has taken their medicine, provides instructions if they have, and maintains a log of dates, times, and the status of medicine intake (1 for taken, 0 for not taken) in a CSV file. The program also calculates and displays a streak of consecutive days with medicine intake and calculates the average percentage of medicine taken over time. The main motivation is to encourage the user to consistently take there medication and provide motivational messages based on there streak.

Features / Complexity:

    Medicine Logging: The program prompts the user to log there medicine intake and provides instructions for using the inhaler.

    Data Storage: Logs are stored in a CSV file for historical tracking.

    Streak Counting: Calculates and displays the current streak of consecutive days with medicine intake.

    Average Calculation: Calculates and displays the average percentage of medicine taken over time.

    Motivational Messages: Provides motivational messages based on the streak, encouraging consistency.

    Favorite Part: My favorite part is the streak counter, which adds personality to the program.

    Least Favorite Part: My least favorite part is saving the information to a CSV file, something I struggled with in the labs and found to be the most time-consuming aspect.
